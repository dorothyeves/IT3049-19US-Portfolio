  <h1>Personal Background</h1>
  <p>
    Dorothy is a Rising Senior in Information Technology concentration in both Cybersecurity and Software Development. 
    Some of her hobbies include building websites for local businesses looking to have an online presence as well music artist websites.
    Most of her coding experience comes from self-learning and through class projects. She attended a 22-week online Software Engineering accelerator course in 2018 where
    she learned Ruby on Rails and JS techniques building fully functional web applications, that included a quote generator app, an IG clone, yelp clone and many others. It 
    helped her to understand how to build web applications from start to finish.
    Aside from learning more code and exploring various areas of interest in Cybersecurity, she also has a history in music.
    She attended a recording engineering school in Nashville, TN where she learned how to track, mix and master songs. Having loved to write songs, she used this skill to record her own songs,
    perform, write for others and record aspiring musicians locally.
    She loves learning new things and looks forward to figuring out her dream career path.
